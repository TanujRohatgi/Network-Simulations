# Network-Simulations
This repository contains a collection of network simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer application i performed as part of my pre-final year training for CCNA as well as a part of my final year project for graduation.

 NOTE : These simulations require Cisco packet tracer application to be setup in order to execute.
